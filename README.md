# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge. However, you can still swipe on the display to backspace, just like on the iPhone.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat(style): hover / active effects. should also work on keyboard input.
- [ ] feat(style): dragging your finger across the buttons it does a hover effect.
- [ ] feat: move backspace button to top-left of display and make it only visible on hover (this is a desktop feature only).
- [ ] fix: why is cursor pointer not working properly?
- [ ] refactor: remove random comments and console.log
- [ ] fix: make the 0 character align with the first column characters
- [ ] fix: can't add comma if "-88 888 888", guess it thinks it's too many digits?
- [ ] feat: show animated "Copied!" message next to the copy button for like 2 seconds
- [ ] refactor: the display text should probably be a text input. that might make the copy funciton more safe and simple.
- [ ] feat: copy function on mobile.
