# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat: add spaces every 4th digit in the display.
- [ ] feat: swiping to the left on the display should backspace.
- [ ] fix: handle mininum and maximum number errors.
- [x] fix: when entering 5 = + = it should display 10.
- [x] fix: when entering 111 = 222 it should display 222 (overwrite the 111).
- [x] fix: when entering 555 = / 5 it displays 1, should be 111.
- [ ] fix: randomly clicking operators without clicking digits and then equals displays NaN. It's a zero division error.
