# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge.

## TO-DO

- [ ] fix: limit amount of characters visible on the display, like round decimals and use scienctific notation.
- [ ] feat: add spaces every 4th digit in the display. \* only do it on non-decimals. Also no spaces at all if the number includes an "e" (scientific notation)
- [ ] feat: swiping to the left on the display should backspace.
- [ ] feat: backspace button.
- [ ] fix: make sure keyboard works as intended.
- [x] fix: when entering 5 = + = it should display 10.
- [x] fix: when entering 111 = 222 it should display 222 (overwrite the 111).
- [x] fix: when entering 555 = / 5 it displays 1, should be 111.
- [x] fix: resets the LEFT when i do 1 + 2 =, displays 3 as it should, then i press digit 5 it displays 5, then 6 it displays 6
