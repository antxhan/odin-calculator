# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge. However, you can still swipe on the display to backspace, just like on the iPhone.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat(style): hover state + dragging finger across the buttons does a hover effect.
- [ ] fix: font sizes on desktop vs mobile.
- [ ] refactor: make code better.
- [ ] refactor: the display text should be a text input, makes the copy function more safe and simple.
- [ ] feat: tooltips for backspace and copy button.
- [ ] feat: copy function on mobile.
- [ ] feat: user should be able to paste.
