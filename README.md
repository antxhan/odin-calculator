# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge. However, you can still swipe on the display to backspace, just like on the iPhone.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat(style): hover / active effects. should also work on keyboard input.
- [ ] feat(style): dragging finger across the buttons does a hover effect.
- [ ] refactor: remove random comments and console.log
- [ ] fix: make the 0 character align with the first column characters
- [ ] fix: can't add comma if "-88 888 888", it thinks there's too many digits
- [ ] refactor: the display text should be a text input, makes the copy function more safe and simple.
- [ ] feat: copy function on mobile.
- [ ] feat: user should be able to paste.
- [ ] fix: when pressing 0 at init state it shouldn't change the C button to C, it should stay AC.
- [ ] feat: tooltips for backspace and copy button.
- [ ] fix: make sure button / svg click propagation works properly.
- [ ] fix: font sizes on desktop vs mobile.
