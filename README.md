# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge.

## TO-DO

- [ ] fix: limit amount of characters visible on the display, like round decimals / use scienctific notation.
- [ ] fix: make sure keyboard works as intended.
- [ ] feat: add spaces every 4th digit in the display. \* only do it on non-decimals. Also no spaces at all if the number includes an "e" (scientific notation)
- [x] feat: swiping to the left on the display should backspace.
- [] feat: using mouse and swiping to the left on the display should backspace?
- [ ] feat: responsive font-size based on digit amount.
- [ ] feat: hover / active effects. should also work on keyboard input.
- [ ] feat: add a footer with credits.
