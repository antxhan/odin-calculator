# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge. However, you can still swipe on the display to backspace, just like on the iPhone.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat(clear): the clear button should change between AC and C.
- [ ] feat(style): responsive font-size based on digit amount.
- [ ] feat(style): hover / active effects. should also work on keyboard input.
- [ ] feat: add a footer with credits + link to instructions and tricks on how to use it.
- [ ] refactor: remove random comments and console.log
