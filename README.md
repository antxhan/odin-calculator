# odin-calculator

My personal goal was to make a calculator as similar as possible to the iPhone iOS 17 calculator. Not just lookswise, but also behaviour wise. The only addition is the backspace button which was part of The Odin Project's extra credit challenge. However, you can still swipe on the display to backspace, just like on the iPhone.

## TO-DO

- [ ] feat(style): hover / active effects. should also work on keyboard input.
- [ ] feat(style): dragging your finger across the buttons it does a hover effect.
- [ ] refactor: remove random comments and console.log
- [ ] fix: when selecting the text in the display on desktop it executes backspace.
- [ ] fix: why is cursor pointer not working properly?
